## [Unreleased] - Expansion Phase
### Added
- **Multi-Platform Source Integration:** Architecting ingestion nodes for LinkedIn (Global Remote), Jobs.cz, and Wellfound, Startup.jobs to widen the upper funnel.
- **Source-Specific Normalization:** Developing custom parsers for data schemas to ensure consistent downstream scoring.

### Changed
- **Parameter Refinement:** Optimizing Startup.jobs URL parameters to increase lead relevancy at the ingestion stage.
- **Execution Monitoring:** Implementing cross-source stability testing to ensure new ingestion nodes don't break existing state-machine logic or deduplication thresholds.
